  "essay": "The given maps indicate the variation of the town of Fosbury’s environs between the years 1980 and 2015. Overall, the area underwent significant changes with a noticeable increase in commercial and recreational development. The most remarkable shift was the construction of major road networks. In 1980, this zone had a main road leading through it from north to south, along with it was tennis courts, fields, block of flats, grocer’s shop and a hotel. Two housing areas could be found in the northwest and northeast, with a park. By 2015, Fosbury had changed with the expansion of commercial facilities. The terraced houses were relocated to where the park once stood to make way for a car park and a supermarket. Moreover, the fields disappeared, and now the southeast features two warehouses. On the other hand, tennis courts and grocer’s shop are were changed and became more advanced by turning into a sports center and supermarket. The existing roads in 1980 had been re-designed with the construction of a roundabout. Unlike the commercial and infrastructure improvements, the houses remain unchanged."
