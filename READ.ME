  "essay": "The provided line graph displays the distribution percentages of Australian exports to four specific countries over a span of 22 years from 1990 to 2012.\nOverall, China emerged as the dominant recipient of Australian exports throughout the period, consistently surpassing the other three countries.\nJapan and the US initially held significant shares in 1990, which dwindled over time, while China experienced substantial growth and India maintained a steady trajectory.\nAt the outset, Japan had the highest demand in 1990, receiving around 20% of Australian exports, while the US accounted for approximately 10%.\nHowever, Japan’s share exhibited a gradual decline, falling to just below 20% by 2000.\nIn contrast, the US experienced a slight decrease in 1995 but rebounded to slightly over 10% by 2000.\nMeanwhile, China and India’s shares were below 5% in 1990, with China showing a steady increase to nearly 5% by 2000, whereas India’s percentage remained constant.\nThroughout the 90s, China witnessed a notable surge in its share of Australian exports, eventually peaking at almost 30% in 2012.\nIn contrast, Japan experienced a continual decline, ending at just above 15%.\nThe US and India displayed more fluctuation but ultimately converged at similar percentages, ranging from 5% to 8% by 2012."
